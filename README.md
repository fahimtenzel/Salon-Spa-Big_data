### **Salon & Spa Business Analytics Project**

Hello! This repository contains my data analytics project, focused on understanding the operations and customer behavior of a Salon & Spa business.

The goal of this project was to take a raw dataset of salon appointments and transform it into actionable business insights. I used a big data approach, leveraging PySpark within a Databricks environment to handle the data processing and analysis.

### **Project Overview & Analysis Questions**

To provide valuable insights, I focused on answering several key business questions:

* **Most Popular Services:** What are the top services that customers are booking?
* **Peak Times:** When are the busiest hours and days for appointments?
* **Staff Performance:** Which staff members are contributing the most in terms of revenue?
* **Customer Loyalty:** Who are the most frequent customers?
* **Revenue Trends:** How does the salon's revenue change over time?

### **Tools Used**

* **PySpark:** For powerful data processing and analysis.
* **Databricks:** The cloud-based platform used to run the PySpark code and visualize the results.
* **GitHub:** To manage the project files and share the final work.

### **Key Findings & Insights**

_Based on the analysis in the notebook, here are some of the key insights I found:_

* **Most Popular Services:** The services "Facial" and "Manicure" are tied for the most popular, each having been booked 16 times. "Pedicure" and "Hair Coloring" are also very popular, with 15 bookings each.

* **Peak Times:** The salon's peak hours are 10 AM and 12 PM. The busiest day of the week is Tuesday, followed by Sunday.

* **Staff Performance:** Staff member `STAFF_01` generated the highest total revenue ($1081.0), while `STAFF_04` completed the most services (28).

* **Customer Loyalty:** Customer `CUST_040` is the most frequent visitor with 7 appointments.

* **Revenue Trends:** The highest revenue day in the dataset was August 19, 2025, which brought in $300.0.

* **Service Bundles:** The analysis showed no highly popular service bundles, as each combination found occurred only once.
